Privacy Policy – Chloe Local TikTok Tools

1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how "Chloe Local TikTok Tools" ("this app") handles data obtained via the official TikTok APIs. This app is a personal tool used only by the owner of the TikTok account and/or her legal guardian. It is not a public or commercial product.

2. Data collected

With the user's explicit authorization through TikTok's OAuth process and the scopes granted (such as "user.info.basic" and "video.list"), this app may access:

- Basic information about the TikTok account (for example, username, profile picture, and other fields allowed by TikTok under "user.info.basic").
- The list of the user's own TikTok videos and associated public metadata (for example, video ID, description, public statistics like view count, like count, comment count, and share count), as allowed by "video.list".

This app does not access:
- TikTok passwords
- Private messages
- Non-public personal information that is not provided by TikTok under these scopes

3. How the data is used

The data is used only for:
- Analyzing the performance of the creator's own videos
- Organizing and managing content and posting strategy

The data is:
- Not sold
- Not shared with third parties
- Not used for targeted advertising or user profiling

4. Data storage

The data may be stored in a private database (for example, a local MongoDB database or another local storage solution) that is accessible only to the creator and/or her legal guardian.

Reasonable measures are taken to protect this data, such as:
- Limiting access to the local device(s)
- Protecting user accounts with passwords
- Restricting network access to the database (for example, running it only on localhost)

5. Data retention and deletion

Data is kept only as long as it is useful for analytics and content management.

If the owner of the TikTok account no longer wants this app to have access to her data, she can:
- Revoke the app’s access in TikTok account settings
- Delete the local database or storage where the TikTok data has been saved

6. Children and legal guardian

This app is used by a minor under the supervision of her legal guardian. The legal guardian is responsible for managing the developer account, API access, and data storage.

For any questions or requests about data handling or deletion, please contact:
